          <h1>Why Ceilings are Beneficial</h1>
            Ceilings are by far the greatest thing that have ever existed.
          They keep you warm and safe. If I didn't have a roof over my head
          I would be subject to tons of harmful natural weather. Not only me, but all.
          They also conceal pumbing and electrical systems, and if something does haywire,
          the people inside would be unsafe. Electrocutions, Floods, and Crying Galore!
          Lucky for you, ceilings are there to be something nice to look at instead. 

          They are also Customizable! White is traditional, but if you'd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse...
          though you might make me jealous. What about the ceiling falling you ask? Impossible! 
          A large natural disaster would do that in a jiffy, but since your ceiling doesn't seem to be going through one I wouldn't worry.
